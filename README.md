# simple_tankwar
This is a simple tankwar game, you can move your tank by press "w", "s", "a", "d", and shot enemies by "j".
* In the menu, you can choose to start a new game or continue the former game if you ever clicked "Save and Exit".
* Still some bugs in the game, feel free to rewrite the codes if you need them.

# simple_tankwar
This is a simple tankwar game, you can move your tank by press "w", "s", "a", "d", and shot enemy by "j".
In the menu, you can choose to start a new game or continue the former game if you ever clicked "Save and Exit".
Still some bugs in the game, feel free to alter the codes if you need them.
